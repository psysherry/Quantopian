    "This project asks us to construct an algorithm to track the SPY index on Quantopian platform. \n",
    "The first thought is that we can construct a portfolio using the top 20 stocks with highest market captalization since the SPY tracks the S&P 500 stock market index. We set our base universe to Q500US.\n",
    "We use data from Jan 2005 to Dec 2015 to test our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We record the tracking error as the difference between the portfolio return and the SPY return. \n",
    "We calculated the SPY return as (SPY price-SPY initial price)/SPY initial price\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the universe updated frenquency to monthly. At first day of each month, we updated our universe by buying top 20 stocks with highest market captalization. Within the month, if some of the stocks becomes unavailable, we reduce our secuity list. When the new month begin, we renew our universe with buying 20 stocks with highest market captalization. Instead of buying equal weight, we buy weight respected to market captalization. We buy more on weight with the stock with higher market captalization. Define:\n",
    "weight = market cap/Sum of market cap of tradable stock in our portfolio\n",
    "We set our trading frequency to daily. We rebalance our portfolio to the weight defined above everyday.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the testing result we find out that the tracking error is getting bigger as time elapse. We did some research and find out that the benchmark represent the total return and reivests dividends. However, the return we calculated does not contain the dividends reivested so there will be more tracking error as the dividend cumulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the algorithm on the testing period which is Jan 2016 to Dec 2017, we obtain a portfolio with beta 0.94 which is close to 1. This means that our portfolio performs similar to the market. Moreover, we have a tracking error around 2% which is relatively small. "
